# üêò PHP OOP Notes & Examples

This repository contains my **learning notes and examples** for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP**.  
It is organized to help beginners understand the **4 pillars of OOP** with clear explanations and runnable code.

## üìñ Topics Covered

1. **OOP Basics**  
   - Classes, objects, properties, methods, `$this`.

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Protecting data using `private` and `protected` properties.  
   - Accessing data safely via getters and setters.

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Reusing and extending parent class functionality with `extends` and `parent::`.

4. **Polymorphism**  
   - Same method names behaving differently in child classes through **method overriding** or **interface implementation**.

5. **Abstraction**  
   - Defining common structures using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**, allowing flexible implementation in child classes.
